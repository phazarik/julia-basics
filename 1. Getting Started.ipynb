    "### Using the binary\n",
    "I have downloaded julia v1.9.3 for linux (64-bit glibc GPG) and unpacked the tarball in my home area. Inside the `bin` directory there is an executable binary named `julia`. You can either source the path to this bin folder by adding somthing like the following in your `.bashrc` -\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing:** Julia is dynamically typed, just like python, meaning you don't need to declare the variable type explicitly.\n",
    "- **Type Annotations:** Type annotations can be used to indicate the expected data type, but they are not enforced during runtime. For example, in python you can do - `x: int = 5`. In julia, you do the same by doing - `x::Int = 5`.\n",
    "- **Type Conversion:**  Python allows for explicit type conversion using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and others to convert variables from one type to another. Julia also supports these kind of type conversion with functions like `convert()`.\n",
    "- **Single vs double quotes:** `\" \"` and `' '` have different meaning in julia. `\" \"` means `str` type, while `' '` is `char` type.\n",
    "- Just like python, julia also has lists, arrays and dictionaries. The syntax is discussed later.\n",
